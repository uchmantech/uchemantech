I have over a decade of experience in IT Support, helping businesses and individuals succeed online by creating secure and effective digital experiences.

I am passionate about cybersecurity and am dedicated to protecting digital assets from online threats.

## Objective

For years, I was a troubleshooter, a problem-solver on the front lines of technology. My mission was to help people navigate their digital lives, resolving their most frustrating tech issues with speed and precision. In the world of end-user tech support, I learned to be calm under pressure, to think on my feet, and to see the interconnectedness of systems. But with every ticket I closed, a new curiosity grewâ€”not just about how things break, but about who or what was trying to break them.

That curiosity evolved into a passion. The more I learned, the more I realized that the real challenge isn't just fixing a broken computer; it's protecting a network from an attack, anticipating a threat before it materializes, and defending the digital fortress. This realization has led me to a new mission: to transition my career and apply my skills in the dynamic world of cybersecurity.

Now, I'm ready to bring my problem-solving experience and my unwavering commitment to a new battleground. I'm actively seeking to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can contribute to a team dedicated to safeguarding the digital world. I'm confident that my background in tech support, combined with my passion for security, makes me a strong candidate ready to take on this challenge.
